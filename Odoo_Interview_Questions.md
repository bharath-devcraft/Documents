### **Twist and tactics-style Odoo interview questions**

### **1. Problem-Solving Under Constraints**
1. **Question**: Your client reports that the `create` button in a custom module's list view disappeared after adding a custom record rule. The record rule seems fine, but the issue persists. How would you debug and resolve this?
   - **Twist**: You cannot remove the record rule, as it's critical for security.

2. **Question**: A customer wants a field in their model to be editable only on certain days of the week. How would you implement this without changing the database schema?
   - **Tactic**: Can you use views, record rules, or on-the-fly validation?

3. **Question**: Your Odoo instance is performing well locally but is slow when deployed on a cloud server. What steps would you take to identify and fix the bottleneck?
   - **Twist**: You only have limited access to the cloud server (e.g., no direct database access).

---

### **2. Security Challenges**
1. **Question**: A user has found a way to bypass security restrictions using a direct API call (e.g., JSON-RPC). How would you address this vulnerability without disrupting existing functionality?
   - **Twist**: The system must still allow API access for valid use cases.

2. **Question**: You are asked to restrict access to a sensitive field in a multi-company setup, but the field should remain visible for users with specific roles. How would you implement this in a way that is both secure and maintainable?

---

### **3. Unexpected Use Cases**
1. **Question**: A user requests an "Undo" button for their transactions module to revert the last action. Odoo doesn’t have this feature by default. How would you implement it?
   - **Twist**: The user insists that this feature must not affect performance and should work even if multiple users are editing simultaneously.

2. **Question**: A client wants to track changes made to specific records but does not want to use the built-in chatter feature. How would you design a lightweight solution?
   - **Tactic**: Can you leverage `write` method overrides or database triggers?

---

### **4. Integration Scenarios**
1. **Question**: An external service sends data in XML format, but Odoo only supports JSON by default for its API. How would you integrate this service into Odoo?
   - **Twist**: The external service does not support any changes to its output format.

2. **Question**: While integrating a payment gateway, you realize that their API rate limits requests, and Odoo's cron job sometimes exceeds this limit. How would you handle this issue?
   - **Tactic**: Focus on queue management and graceful error handling.

---

### **5. Data and Reports**
1. **Question**: A client complains that a custom report takes too long to generate due to a large number of records. How would you optimize the report generation?
   - **Twist**: The client insists on keeping all the current data fields in the report.

2. **Question**: The finance department wants a dynamic report that changes based on a user’s role but doesn’t want a separate report for each role. How would you approach this?
   - **Tactic**: Think about views, contexts, and access control.

---

### **6. Module Design**
1. **Question**: You are tasked with building a custom module for managing subscription plans. A requirement emerges mid-project that subscriptions should auto-renew and send reminders. How would you incorporate this change without breaking existing functionality?
   - **Twist**: The deadline remains unchanged.

2. **Question**: Your custom module uses computed fields extensively, and a client complains that form views load too slowly. What strategies would you use to resolve this issue?
   - **Tactic**: Focus on balancing usability and performance.

---

### **7. Debugging Scenarios**
1. **Question**: A workflow automation in Odoo triggers twice for the same record under specific conditions. How would you identify the root cause and fix it?
   - **Twist**: The issue only occurs sporadically, making it hard to replicate.

2. **Question**: A Kanban view is throwing a "Field not found" error after you added a new computed field. The error doesn't appear in any other views. How would you debug this issue?
   - **Tactic**: Consider view inheritance and model synchronization.

---

### **8. Code Maintenance**
1. **Question**: During a code review, you discover that the custom module you inherited has no tests and poor documentation. You’re tasked with improving its reliability. What steps would you take?
   - **Twist**: The module is already in production, so you need to avoid disruptions.

2. **Question**: You need to refactor a method in a core Odoo module to improve its readability and reduce cyclomatic complexity. How would you ensure your changes don’t break existing functionality?
   - **Tactic**: Think about dependency management and modular design.

---

### **9. Scenario-Based Tactics**
1. **Scenario**: The CEO of a company using Odoo wants a dashboard to display live data for sales, inventory, and employee attendance. What challenges might arise, and how would you address them?
2. **Scenario**: You’re asked to deploy an Odoo instance with minimal downtime. What strategies would you use to ensure a seamless deployment?
